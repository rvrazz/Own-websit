The absorption and utilization of food by the body is fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion. Plants, which convert solar energy to food by photosynthesis, are the primary food source. Animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food for other animals. To learn more about the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to organism, see food chain. </p>

            <h1>soup</h1>
            <p>I have made this for many whom have given it the title. This takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe. (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.)</p>

            <p>This simple, tasty and easy Vegetable Curry with chickpeas and coconut milk is a weeknight, one-pot favorite that cooks up in under 30 minutes. Chickpeas are simmered with veggies like potatoes, sweet potatoes and carrots, and flavored with spices like cardamom and curry powder. Coconut milk adds a creamy and delicious finishing touch. Serve this curry over a bed of rice or quinoa. A vegan, gluten-free, soy-free and nut-free recipe.</p>
